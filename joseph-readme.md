> Code Example 1: in the below code I did x to make y happen...
```js
console.log('something');
function(){}
```
> Code Example 2: In the code below, I used classes to implement a cached background color, a padding of 3%, and a height of 100% on a div.
```html
<div class="quaternaryBGC p-3 h-100"><h1>Personalized Approach</h1>
                <p>What sets Samiranna apart is
                  our personalized approach to
                  each project.Taking the time
                  to understand the unique stories
                  and preferences of clients,
                  ensuring that each photoshoot
                  reflects the individuality of the
                  people and the event.
                </p></div>
```
> Code example 3: In the CSS below, I optimized the index page for mobile screens by styling the elements of the page's wrapper. I used @media to assign these styles for mobile resolution. I made sure there was no whitespace with the use of margin 0, padding 0, and overflow hidden.
```css
@media (max-width:768px){
    .site-container{
        width:100%;
        margin: 0;
        padding:0;
        overflow: hidden;
    }
}
```
